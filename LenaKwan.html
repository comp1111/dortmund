            <p>Although Lena occassionally looks like a person, she is actually a loaf of bread. More specifically a loaf of cat bread masquearading as a human being.<br/><br/>
                In her spare time she enjoys eating jam and drinking milk tea because those two things go very well with bread, but she will occassionally enjoy some peanutbutter.<br/>
                She is currently adventuring at BCIT in hopes of gaining knowledge about coding and successfully constructing a network of cohorts so she can blend in better.
					<br/><br/><br/>
					She is hopefully not toast.</p>
            <p>Lena can be reached through D2L or by throwing bread out the window.</p>
