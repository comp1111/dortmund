                There once was a man that traveled the world of Dormundor. He traveled the 7 oceans for 3 months and 9 continents
                for 9 years. He searched and high and low for something that would satisfy his stomach. But he could not taste any flavors
                that would resemble the salty and sweet sensation of soy sauce back in his home country. He decided that he would give up and settle down one day with a woman that could cook as well as she could smile. That was his second dream and one
                that would not be fulfilled. No matter where he went, he could not find a woman that could cook and smile. Why?
                It was because the world of cooking was so primitive that there existed only 10 chefs in history. Everyone else
                lacked the taste for a palette. It is said that these 10 chefs disappeared years ago leaving recipes hidden away in
                obscure locations. The man lost hope and decided to go to BCIT to learn programming so he could feed himself
                virtual luxuries. This man is invested in CST and his currently working through first term. This man sits next to me.
                This man is a savage and he loves cats and kotatsus. He is also a cat.
