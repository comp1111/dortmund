            <p>Hello fellow students of Set D, I am Daniel Gibeau. After cooking professionally for 7 years I've decided to go back to school and learn how to make super awesome spectactular fantastical ludicrously good programs! I am reclusive by nature, so please don't take it personally when I just ghost for no reason whatsoever. This is the second time we've had to try and describe ourselves for an introduction thing, isn't that grand? By the end of this we'll have all this personal information on random parts of the BCIT network and future employers will be able to find it and we'll all be taken down Bill Cosby style, super fun! Why are you still reading this? Go home. Or, if you're already home, make yourself a sandwich. They're pretty great. <span>Who am I kidding, we're CST students, we don't go home anymore.</span></p>
            <p>If you guys want to contact me, my email is dgibeau@gmail.com. Or we could just use Slack or something.</p>
